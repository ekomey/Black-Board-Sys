# Black-Board-Sys
Blackboard systems used for generating poems are inspired by how experts successfully alter the blackboard given a set of inputs. As each expert’s contribution revolves around a specific task in the poetry generation process, which is then presented on the blackboard for further alteration by the experts until a problem is solved. This study covers the design and implementation of additional experts into a blackboard system, attempting to produce more poetic speeches. We have three distinct experiments for the generating process: Based on a part of the text from the corpora, the system (1) replaces a word with one of it’s synonyms according to its part of the speech (i.e. noun with noun, adjective with adjective, etc.) (2) replaces words with synonyms that have the same sound as the word before, and (3) replaces a word with one of its hyponyms. Finally, we evaluate the fluency of the generation poem.
